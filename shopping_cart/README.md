# Shopping cart

## What do we want to build?

We are building a shopping cart for an online grocery shop. The idea of this kata is to build the product in an
iterative way.

## Technical requirements

- The price per unit is calculated based on the product cost and the percentage of revenue that the company wants for
  that product.
- The price has to be rounded up; so if a price per unit calculated is 1.7825, then the expected price per unit for that
  product is 1.79
- The final price of the product is then calculated as the price per unit with the VAT rounded up.
- Products are not allowed to have the same name.
